\section{Introduction}
Chess has been one of the world's most popular games for centuries. Over 10 years ago, it was estimated that 605 million adults regularly play chess \cite{fidePressRelease2012}. In the intervening years, the popularity of the game has continued to grow alongside the growth of online gaming where Chess.com alone surpassed 20 million members in 2017 \cite{chessMembers}. With so many chess players around the world, when two meet, how might one predict the winner of the game? This paper compares two Machine Learning models, Logistic Regression and Decision trees, applied to this problem.

This is where the introduction goes. Test ref by \cite{100MLB}.
